= stanfordparser

This is an upload/extension of Bill McNeal's stanfordparser rubyforge gem, check it out at its homepage (seems to be partially in French)

http://rubyforge.org/projects/stanfordparser/

or its rdocs

http://stanfordparser.rubyforge.org/

I've been having issues trying to use this gem so I decided to upload it to github and try to organize it to be a little more gem-friendly, especially using jeweler.

AFAIK there aren't other copies of this on github, please correct me if I'm mistaken. The only similar one I can see is http://github.com/tiendung/ruby-nlp which has much less code and I can only assume to be something else.

It seems like using version 1.6.1 of the java StanfordParser package is your best bet for compatability.

See README.orig.rdoc for Bill's readme, which includes dependencies, installation, and usage.

== Branches

* master - Jeweler and Bundler integrated along with slight reorganization of files to be more gem-standard. This is the branch you should use if you want to source the gem straight from github. I will leave this branch alone for the most part unless I find/come up with stable and useful additions. All changes will be backwards compatible.
* stock - Almost untouched from Bill's version, except for the README. Use this branch if that's what you're looking for.
* fixing_tests - The tests are currently broken, this branch is trying to address that. Once the tests are fixed it will be merged back into master. Help appreciated! I'll keep a TESTS_STATUS.rdoc keeping track of progress.
* experimental - I'll be putting in some code as examples and testing out some ideas. Do not use this branch as a gem. You are very encouraged, however, to fork it and add some code/make my code better. I'll try to integrate all the pull requests I get, if not in that branch into another.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. I would prefer rSpec, but TestUnit is acceptable as well since there are some of those from the original author.
* Commit.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
